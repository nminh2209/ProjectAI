## I. Introduction

### 1.1 Subject Definition
This report presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an intelligent FAQ chatbot system specifically developed for Swinburne Vietnam's admission service. The system combines database-driven FAQ matching with generative AI capabilities to provide automated responses to prospective students' inquiries.

### 1.2 Problem Context
Educational institutions, particularly universities, face a significant challenge in managing repetitive inquiries from prospective students and their families. Traditional admission services are overwhelmed with common questions about:
- Admission requirements and procedures
- Tuition fees and payment methods
- Program offerings and curriculum details
- Application deadlines and documentation
- Campus facilities and student services

These repetitive inquiries consume substantial staff time and resources, often leading to inconsistent responses and delayed communication with potential students.

### 1.3 Problem Significance
Addressing this problem is crucial for several reasons:

**Efficiency:** Manual response handling is time-intensive and scales poorly with increasing inquiry volume.

**Consistency:** Human responses may vary in quality and accuracy, potentially providing conflicting information.

**Availability:** Traditional support operates within business hours, limiting accessibility for international students in different time zones.

**Resource Optimization:** Staff can focus on complex, personalized inquiries requiring human expertise rather than routine questions.

**User Experience:** Immediate responses improve prospective student satisfaction and engagement with the institution.

### 3.3 Implementation Details

#### 3.3.1 Backend Architecture

**Framework:** Flask (Python) - chosen for rapid development and extensive library ecosystem

**Database:** SQLAlchemy with SQLite - provides ORM capabilities and easy deployment

**AI Integration:** Google Gemini 2.0-flash-exp - offers advanced language understanding with cost-effective API usage

#### 3.3.2 FAQ Matching Algorithm

The system implements a hybrid matching approach combining four distinct algorithms:

1. **Fuzzy String Matching** (30% weight)
   ```python
   fuzzy_score = fuzz.ratio(user_question, faq_question)
   ```

2. **Partial Ratio Matching** (30% weight)
   ```python
   partial_score = fuzz.partial_ratio(user_question, faq_question)
   ```

3. **Token Sort Ratio** (20% weight)
   ```python
   token_score = fuzz.token_sort_ratio(user_question, faq_question)
   ```

4. **Keyword Intersection** (20% weight)
   ```python
   keyword_score = (len(common_words) / len(user_words)) * 100
   ```

The combined score determines FAQ relevance:
- **≥70%:** Direct FAQ response
- **<70%:** AI fallback with FAQ context

#### 3.3.3 Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table for authentication
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(120) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- FAQ management table
CREATE TABLE faq (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'General',
    keywords VARCHAR(255),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Question logging for analytics
CREATE TABLE question_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(120),
    question TEXT,
    answer TEXT,
    is_faq BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    faq_id INTEGER REFERENCES faq(id),
    match_score FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 3.3.4 Admin Panel Features

The administrative interface provides comprehensive FAQ management:

- **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, delete FAQs
- **Category Management:** Organize FAQs by topic
- **Priority System:** Control FAQ relevance ranking
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Monitor usage patterns and performance
- **Real-time Updates:** Immediate reflection of changes

#### 3.3.5 AI Integration Strategy

The system uses context-aware prompting for AI fallback:

```python
prompt = f"""
